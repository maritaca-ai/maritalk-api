# Introduction to Sabiá

Maritaca AI's models specialized in the Portuguese language, known as Sabiá, are available in two ways: through Maritaca API and locally with MariTalk Local. Via Maritaca API, you can access the Sabiá-2 Medium, Sabiá-2 Small, and Sabiá-3 models. With MariTalk Local, you can use the Sabiá-2 Medium and Sabiá-2 Small models directly on your own infrastructure.

Charging for the use of the models through Maritaca API is based on the volume of tokens, considering both input and output data. The specialized training of the Sabiá models ensures superior performance at a more accessible cost compared to other market solutions. With the flexibility to choose between local implementation or via API, Sabiá adapts to the specific needs of your project.
