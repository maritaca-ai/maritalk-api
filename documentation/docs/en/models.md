TPM = Tokens per minute.

RPM = Requests per minute.

This table excludes all of our deprecated models.

**The sabia-2-small model will be deprecated on 2025-01-15. We recommend changing to sabiazinho-3.**

**The sabia-3-2024-09-09 model will be deprecated on 2025-02-15. We recommended changing to sabia-3.**

### How do I know how many tokens I will be charged?
To know in advance how much your requests will cost, use the function count_tokens to find out the number of tokens in a given prompt.
```python

from maritalk import count_tokens

prompt = "How many sticks does it take to make a canoe?"

total_tokens = count_tokens(prompt, model="sabia-3")

print(f'The prompt "{prompt}" contains {total_tokens} tokens.')
```

You need to install the maritalk library (`pip install maritalk`) to run the code snippet above.
